## ðŸŒŸ What is Streamlit?

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that helps you create **interactive web apps** easily â€” without writing any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

In this project, Streamlit is used to:

- Create a chat-like interface.
- Take user input (questions).
- Show AI responses in chat format.
- Maintain chat history using session state.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
```python
import streamlit as st
st.title("Gemini Chatbot")
prompt = st.chat_input("Ask something")
st.chat_message("user").write(prompt)
